# footballdrop

This repo contains various raw scripts with code I used for football-related posts [on my blog](https://stmorse.github.io/blog.html).  It is not intended to be clean or user-friendly, just hopefully helpful if you're trying to reproduce a plot from the blog.  It is moderately well-commented though!

Here's a running list of football-related posts which I either have, or plan to have, code for here:

- [Clustering WRs by Catch Yardage](https://stmorse.github.io/journal/clustering-nfl-players-by-play-distributions.html).  Code in blog.
- [Using ESPN's (new) API](https://stmorse.github.io/journal/espn-fantasy-v3.html).  Most code in blog, some additional in `lucky_drop.ipynb`.
- [Checking ESPN's Fantasy Projections](https://stmorse.github.io/journal/espn-fantasy-projections.html).  Code in blog.
- [Scraping ProFootball Reference](https://stmorse.github.io/journal/pfr-scrape-python.html). Code in blog.
- [Measuring Fantasy Roster Skill](https://stmorse.github.io/journal/fantasy-bench.html).  Code in `roster_management_clean.ipynb`.
